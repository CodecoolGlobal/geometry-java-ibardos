# Geometry - a console application

**Topic:** A multiplatform console application with geometrical Shapes in focus. You can create, store, and able to
get different information/statistics about your collection.

**The aim of the project:** This project was an important part of my Object-oriented Java learning curve. The intention
was to create an interactive, yet stylish console application, with the highest standards of OOP design, and
User Experience quality. The application is able to validate user inputs, therefore it can act accordingly: sends response
about wrong input, handle exceptions without a crash. Via complex String manipulation features, it is capable of creating
a table, consisting of stored Shape objects, with dynamic column width allocation.

## What I have used during development:
- Java
- Maven
- Shell scripting
- PlantUML
- Object-oriented programming
  - OOP principles
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
  - SOLID principles
  - Static fields/methods
  - String manipulation
  - Input validation
  - Exception handling
  - ArrayList, HashMap

## How to use:
1. Fork my repository (do not clone it!)
2. Open your Command Line Interface (Terminal) **in the folder** of the project *(see Hints)*
3. Install Apache Maven, if you haven't already, from here:
<a target="_blank" href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">Maven download</a>
4. Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), if you haven't already, from here:
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">Java download</a>
5. You have a predefined Shell script in the project's root folder, which can build and run the application:
   - To run the script, use this Terminal command from the root folder of the repository: ```sh geometry_build_and_run.sh```
   - In case of Windows OS, if the latter doesn't work, you can simply click on the "geometry_build_and_run.sh" file
   at your file explorer
6. Use the application in your Terminal. Make your inputs with your keyboard:
   - Your inputs will be all validated, so don't need to worry about bugs or crashes. :)
7. Be happy!

## Hints:
- You can check whether you already have Maven on your machine by using the following Terminal command: ```mvn --version```
- You can check whether you already have JRE on your machine by using the following Terminal command: ```java --version```
- If you need to install JRE, choose the appropriate version for your operating system on the link above
- If you don't understand something: Google it, or feel free to contact me.
